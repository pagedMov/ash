# Slash Shell

A Linux shell written in Rust. Mainly a pet project I am using to learn Rust more deeply. In it's current state, it is about as usable as bash, though it is still pretty unstable and there are a few crashes that I have yet to find a cause for. It has all of the features you would expect from bash, and a few modern features like detailed error reporting, prompt scripting, and syntax highlighting.
